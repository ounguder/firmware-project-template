# Design Review — [PROJECT NAME]

> Filled by Claude during Phase 2 of `/new-project` (Design Review Interview).
> Review and approve this document before Phase 3 (Technical Kickoff) begins.

## Purpose

<!-- What must this project achieve? What is the goal? -->
<!-- Is this a standalone task or one step in a larger system? -->


---

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- What observable, measurable outcomes define "done" for this project? -->
<!-- What will you demonstrate, measure, or observe to declare the project complete? -->

| # | Criterion | How to verify |

## Available Resources

### Hardware

<!-- MCU evaluation boards (model, variant) -->
<!-- Sensors and actuators (type, interface, part number) -->
<!-- Custom PCBs (designed / in manufacturing / arrived / verified) -->
<!-- Power supply (lab bench, battery, solar, USB) -->


### Software Infrastructure

<!-- Existing services (MQTT broker, cloud backend, database) -->
<!-- Existing firmware from previous tasks that can be reused -->
<!-- Build environment already set up (PlatformIO, STM32CubeIDE, ESP-IDF) -->


### Laboratory Instruments

<!-- Oscilloscope, logic analyzer, multimeter -->
<!-- RF instruments (spectrum analyzer, VNA, signal generator) -->
<!-- Programming and debug probes (ST-LINK, J-Link, FTDI) -->


---

## Development Ideas Discussed

<!-- Approaches considered during the design review interview -->
<!-- Trade-offs evaluated -->


---

## Selected Approach

<!-- The agreed direction — architecture and implementation strategy summary -->
<!-- Why this approach was chosen over alternatives -->


---

## Constraints

<!-- Hard requirements (low power, specific protocol, specific sensor, cost ceiling) -->
<!-- Time constraints -->
<!-- Physical constraints (enclosure size, connector type, cable length) -->


---

## Open Questions and Unknowns

<!-- Unresolved technical questions that need investigation -->
<!-- Dependencies on external information (datasheet, PCB arrival, vendor response) -->
<!-- Items that may cause the selected approach to change -->
